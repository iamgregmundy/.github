# Greg: A Users Guide
## Give Me Opportunities to Demonstrate
I interact with the world in a tangible way. I build, model, and construct. Give me the opportunity to
demonstrate how something works, rather than simply tell you about it. Whenever possible, let’s meet
in person, as it helps me to read your non-verbals.

Quality matters. I need to work with the best materials and make a high-quality, long-lasting product. I
will often move around and change space, because that helps me to focus. Sitting at the desk all day is
counterproductive for me.

## Allow Me to Guesstimate
Give me a chance to respond to change after I’ve had a little time to let the notion settle in. I am willing
to test new approaches when you qualify the amount of risk involved. A little change is OK, but my
threshold is not unbounded. I’ll roll with the punches when there are a few unknowns, but I need you to
fill in the gaps when everything is up in the air.

If you hit me with a lot of immediate deadlines, I’ll pull back. You’ll get my best work by limiting the
sense of urgency to a few issues at a time. I respond to essential risks and deadlines, but I won’t get
riled up for the mere sake of creating an intense effort.

## Let Me Find the Fastest Route
I don’t need a plan to act. My instinct is to find the fastest route to the solution, so I’ll do it a different
way every time. I’m a natural multi-tasker and keep lots of balls in the air at once. I drop balls along the
way too. I’m a starter, not a finisher. You can help me by picking up where I leave off. 

Give me diverse challenges, so no two days are the same. Don’t worry about interrupting me. I thrive
when I switch gears and can’t stand getting stuck in a routine. You will lose my attention if things drag
out or become too repetitious.

## Give Me Information, but Not Too Much 
Start with the bottom line and let me ask questions to get the amount of detail I need. When in doubt,
give me the Executive Summary. Please be brief and to-the-point in your emails, so I can get to the
heart of the matter. I’m much better at reviewing collected data than leading the research effort.

I probably won’t read the whole report or need the entire explanation. That doesn’t mean I don’t value
your work. In fact, I respect your contributions so much that I don’t need to rehash the material. 

If something is new to me or the situation requires it, I’ll delve deep. But I reach a point of exhaustion
with the fact-finding and need to move on.
